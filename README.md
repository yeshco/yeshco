I've been trying to get good at it for the last 7 years but my anxiety hasn't let me take advantage of those years as I would have wanted (:\
I've learned mostly HTML, CSS and JS and I just finished a course on that. \
I'm trying now to get better at Math, I'm building a website at [yeshco.xyz](yeshco.xyz) and I'm trying to get more active here.\
I have some Knowledge of:
- JavaScript
- Nodejs
